## *EXPLANATION*

First, we fill the 3-liter jug and transfer it to the 5-liter jug, leaving space for 2 more liters. Then the 3-liter jug is refilled, and 2 liters are added to the 5-liter jug, leaving 1 liter in the 3-liter jug. We then empty the 5-liter jug and pour the remaining 1 liter into it. After refilling the 3-liter jug, we transfer its 3 liters to the 5-liter jug, resulting in exactly 4 liters of water.
