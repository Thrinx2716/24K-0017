**START**\
  // Input kilometers per second\
  INPUT Kps
  
  // Multiply by conversion factor\
  Mph = Kps * 2237
  
  // Output miles per hour\
  PRINT Mph\
**END**

## *EXPLANATION*

We will take an Input of kilometers per second (kps) to be converted to miles per hour (mph). It is possible to convert the units by multiplying the given velocity in kilometers per second by 2237 to get miles per hour, which gives a very close approximation. Finally, we will output the result as speed in miles per hour. This approach makes the solution very simple: we can convert the units easily and show the result.
