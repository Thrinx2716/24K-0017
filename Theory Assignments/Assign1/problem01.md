## *PSEUDOCODE*

**START**\
  *// Input*\
  PRINT "Enter the speed in kilometers per second: "
  INPUT Kps
  
  *// Process*\
  Mph = Kps * 2237
  
  *// Output*\
  PRINT "The speed in miles per hour is: ", Mph\
**END**

## *EXPLANATION*

We will take an Input of kilometers per second (kps) to be converted to miles per hour (mph). It is possible to convert the units by multiplying the given velocity in kilometers per second by 2237 to get miles per hour, which gives a very close approximation. Finally, we will output the result as speed in miles per hour. This approach makes the solution very simple: we can convert the units easily and show the result.
